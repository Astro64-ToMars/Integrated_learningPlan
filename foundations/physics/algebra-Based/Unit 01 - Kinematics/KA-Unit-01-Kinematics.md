## Scalars and Vectors in 1D

**What is a phycisist's goal?**
1. Define the most fundemental, measurable quantities in the universe
2. Find *relationships* between those fundemental quantities

**Vecors and scalars are necessary to do this.**

**Scalars:** Quantities with only magnitude (size), but no direction. Some examples of scalar quantities are:
- Mass
- Distance
- Speed
- Volume
- Temperature
- Energy

**Vectors:** Quantities with magnitude (size) and direction  
- In order to indicate that a quantity is a vector, vector notation is used.  
- In vector notation, An arrow is drawn over the symbol to denote that the quantity is a vector.  
- Sometimes, when typing, vector quantities are denoted in bold to distinguish them from scalar quantities.  
- The direction of a vector quantity can be denoted by a positive/negative sign to denote left/right
- The length of the vector represents the magnitude and vector quantity. The direction the arrow points represents the direction of the vector quantity.
- Vectors shold be drawn *reasonably* to scale with resepct to each other. For example, a 10 m/s vector should be twice as long as a 5 m/s vector.
- If a vector has the same direction and magnitude as another vector, both are equal.
Some examples of vector quantities are:
- Position
- Displacement
- Velocity
- Acceleration

**Adding/Subtracting vectors:**   

**Adding:** To add vectors visually, we must place the second vector at the tip of the first, and add the magnitudes of the two vectors together. The direction of both vectors must be the same if they are being added.   

**Subtracting:** If we are subtracting vectors, that means they are placed in opposite directions. The final direction of the difference will be of the larger vector. In order to subtract two vectors, we take away the smaller vector from the larger.  

### Keep in mind
- You cannot add two scalars/vectors of different types of quantities. For example, you cannot add temperature quantities to volume quantities, or velocity quantities to displacement quantities. It is imporatnt to pay attention to units to avoid this mistake.
- Clearly define your coordinate system before doing vector calculations. Positive vectors can look like scalars with no sign. Direction and signs are very important with vectors, even if the direction is implied.
