## Scalars and Vectors in 1D

**What is a phycisist's goal?**
1. Define the most fundemental, measurable quantities in the universe
2. Find *relationships* between those fundemental quantities

**Vecors and scalars are necessary to do this.**

**Scalars:** Quantities with only magnitude (size), but no direction. Some examples of scalar quantities are:
- Mass
- Distance
- Speed
- Volume
- Temperature
- Energy

**Vectors:** Quantities with magnitude (size) and direction  
- In order to indicate that a quantity is a vector, vector notation is used.  
- In vector notation, An arrow is drawn over the symbol to denote that the quantity is a vector.  
- Sometimes, when typing, vector quantities are denoted in bold to distinguish them from scalar quantities.  
- The direction of a vector quantity can be denoted by a positive/negative sign to denote left/right
- The length of the vector represents the magnitude and vector quantity. The direction the arrow points represents the direction of the vector quantity.
- Vectors shold be drawn *reasonably* to scale with resepct to each other. For example, a 10 m/s vector should be twice as long as a 5 m/s vector.
- If a vector has the same direction and magnitude as another vector, both are equal.
Some examples of vector quantities are:
- Position
- Displacement
- Velocity
- Acceleration

**Adding/Subtracting vectors:**   

**Adding:** To add vectors visually, we must place the second vector at the tip of the first, and add the magnitudes of the two vectors together. The direction of both vectors must be the same if they are being added.   

**Subtracting:** If we are subtracting vectors, that means they are placed in opposite directions. The final direction of the difference will be of the larger vector. In order to subtract two vectors, we take away the smaller vector from the larger.  

### Keep in mind
- You cannot add two scalars/vectors of different types of quantities. For example, you cannot add temperature quantities to volume quantities, or velocity quantities to displacement quantities. It is imporatnt to pay attention to units to avoid this mistake.
- Clearly define your coordinate system before doing vector calculations. Positive vectors can look like scalars with no sign. Direction and signs are very important with vectors, even if the direction is implied.

### Different Quantities

**Position:** "Location"; Location is always measured with respect to a reference point. Using that reference point, we can find the position with respect to where the reference point is. We must use direction in relation to the reference point to define position. As a result, position is a vector quantity. Usually, in convention, x is used to denote position. *Position is always in relation to another, specific reference frame (point).*

**Velocity:** Measure of "How quickly the position changes." Velocity is a vector quantity, because position is also a vector quantity. A velocity like $5~\mathrm{m/s}$ states that if the car was travelling at a constant speed, its position would change 5 meters every second. Change in position is defined as the "final position" minus the "initial position". Remember, velocity can be to the right, or to the left because velocity is a vector quantity and has direction.

$${v = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}}$$

Velocity is equal to the change in position, divided by the time taken for that change in position to occur.

**Speed:** Measure of "How quickly a specific distance is travelled"

$${speed = \frac{distance}{time}}$$

Speed is equal to the distance travelled, divided by the time taken to travel that distance.

**Displacement:** An objects change in position. Displacement is a vector value, with both magnitude and direction. In 1 dimension, displacement is always a straight vector representing the movement of an object *in a straight line*.

$${\Delta\vec{x} = \vec{x} - \vec{x}_0}$$

In this formula, final (current) position - initial position is represented. It states that displacement is the change in an object's position, or, equivalently the difference between the object's final and initial position. Keep in mind, change in position also has a direction quantity. 

**Note:** $\Delta$ represents the *change* in a variable. When it is placed in front of a variable, it refers to the difference between the final value and initial value of that variable.

### What is the difference between displacement and distance travelled?

Displacement takes into account the direction an object moves. For example, if an object moves 3 units to the right, but then turns back and moves 1 unit to the left again, its displacement will be 2 units to the right. However, left moving vector will also be added to the final "distance travelled" vector. This doesn't occur in the final "displacement" vector which subtracts both the right vector and the left vector.

### What is the difference between speed and velocity?

Speed is the measure of *distance* which doesn't contain the element of direction. Speed only has a magnitude, or is a scalar quantity, but velocity contains direction. In conclusion, speed is just velocity without direction. Velocity is the measure of "the change in position" while speed is the measure of the "change in distance", and distance doesn't change based on direction, while position does.

### Common Mistakes and Misconceptions
- **Swapping the initial and final positions in the displacement equations.** A lot of times, the intial positon is put first in the displacement equation which gives the incorrect displacement vector.
- **Distance and displacement are not "different names for the same quantity"**. They are different constants. Changes in direction causes displacement to decrease, but causes "distance travelled" to continue increasing.
- **The "correct" coordinate system:** All coordinate systems are valid, so any can be chosen. The reference point and coordinate system will affect the numbers in the calculation, but as long as the same coordinate system is used throughout, the final meaning of the answwer will not change. Reference frames make physics very flexible.
