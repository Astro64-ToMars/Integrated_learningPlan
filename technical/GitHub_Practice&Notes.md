# GitHub Practice
**Description:** I can use this document to write any notes on GitHub and practice my techniques for GitHub

Tools used: Net Ninja, 

**Git:** 
- A system that records changes to a file over time
- Specific versions of that file can be recalled
- Many people can easily collaborate on a project and have their own version of project files

**Github:**
- An online service that hosts our projects
- Code can be easily shared with other developers
- Developers can work on projects individually, and then reupload their edits and merge them with the main code

**Standard Git Bash Commands:**
- ls: Lists files and directories in current location
- cd --: Changes the directory to the one prior
- cd <directory>: Changes the current directory to the specified path
- mkdir <directory>: Creates a new directory
- touch <file?: Creates a new, empty file
- rm <file>: Removes (deletes the file)

**Repositories (Repo's):** 
- Container for a project you want to track with Git
- Can have many different repo's for many different projects on our computer
- The contents of all repo's are tracked by Git
- a ".git" file is a repository being tracked by Git. The ".git" file needs to be at the root of the repository

**Commits:*** A version history where you can return to any "commited change" at any point. It is like a "save point"  
You can rewind back to any commit in the commit history you want using Git.

**3 stages of Commits:**
- Modified: Changes are made to a folder, but they are not committed. They are modified, but are not ready to be made a "save point"
- Staging: Stores the files which are changed and basically says, "I want the files in this area to be taken a snapshot of."
- Commited: Any files in the "staging area" are added to the commit section when committed.
